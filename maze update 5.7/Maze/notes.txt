okay so I should do things like this

a flag signalling moves are in progress
no further actions should be taken

okay so a while loop that waits for a flag
this flag indicates that the player has put in a move
all other objects then take their actions

so set in progress to false
if something needs longer draws then set to true

so it seems that the main loop waits for an input
then does something so something is making it wait

okay so need to implement a turn function
turn and then move
so i need to store enemy and player direction

will have your own txt file
that will contain the file
it will then load

the text file will need player, enemy, chest, arrows
as inputs as well

have to pick up arrows to shoot

player direction
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12


okay currently enemies move when action taken
use a boolean
boolean action queued
action in progress
basically like this:
if true
	then the enemy can make a move
	there needs to be counter to simulate parametric movement


while (!actionComplete)
	do Actions

so do an action while there are things

okay so there is a struct for player actions
a single bool for enemy movement
a single bool to mark if actions in progress

if not in progress
{
	mark enemy and player can take an action
	set can take action to false
}

player->action()
enemy->action()
