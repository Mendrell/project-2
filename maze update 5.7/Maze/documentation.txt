Project goal: Create a 2d game 
	implementing Dyjkstras search
	algorithm.

Player Movement : arrow keys up, down
	left, and right move the player
	respectively.

Shoot : press space to shoot must first
	pick up arrows.

	either kill or avoid enemies.

To make custom map: Open a text file

		grid 10 0
	add walls and enemies.
		wall x y
		enemy x y
	add 1 player 1 chest 1 arrows
		player x y
		chest x y
		arrows x y
	file name should be saved as 
	mapgen.txt
	mapgen1.txt
	mapgen2.txt
	mapgen3.txt

	asciiMapToCoordinateList.cpp converts an ascii map to a coordinate list
		to help visually create a map
	compiled using c++11
	character list

	empty = '_';
	wall = '#';
	enemy = 'e';
	player = 'p';
	chest = 'c';
	ammo = 'a';
